# What's this

Codes I've done for the labs in *Cyber Security* lesson at Harbin Institute of Technology, in 2021 spring.

# Philosophy

> Good design, clean code. Shouldn't we?

# How to use

1. Download `.zip` or `git clone https://github.com/keuin/CyberSecurityLabs.git` on your favorite Linux machine.
2. Read the instruction which your teachers send you.
2. Read the code, understand how the program works.
3. *Write* your own code. **DO NOT JUST COPY MY CODE**. **本实现仅供参考，发布出来是给大家做实验提供思路。作为工大的学生，请诸位将校训铭记在心，切勿照抄！**

*P.S. Files named as `*.gpg` are backups of my reports. They are not supposed to be accessible from public.*
