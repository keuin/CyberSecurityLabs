Codes I've done for the lab in *Cyber Security* lesson at Harbin Institute of Technology.

# Philosophy

> Good design, clean code. Shouldn't we?

# How to use

1. Download `.zip` or `git clone https://github.com/keuin/CyberSecurityLabs.git` on your favorite Linux machine.
2. Read the instruction which your teachers send you.
2. Read the code, understand how the program works.
3. *Write* your own code. **DO NOT JUST COPY MY CODE**.

*P.S. Files named as `*.gpg` are my backups. They are not supposed to be accessed from public, so stop trying to decrypt them.*
